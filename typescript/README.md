#### 4. Import the SDK

Once you have installed the SDK, import it into your project. With the imported SDK, create an instance of the DappLookerChartsAPI and make API calls using the API key and chart UUID obtained in the previous steps.

### Examples
Here's an example of how you can use the DappLooker SDK:

```javascript
//Javascript
const DappLookerChartsAPI = require("dapplooker-sdk");

async function getChartData() => {
  let chartUUID = "dc9b69d8-7ca1-45d4-8ad0-a17f915f3f0"; // Replace it with chart UUID you are working with
  let apiKey = "qzusb5p3q246ip246ab6g0p8ppzb7u"; // Replace it with your API key
  let outputFormat = 'json' // This is a optional argument, valid value is `json`.
  
  let response = await DappLookerChartsAPI.getChartData(chartUUID, apiKey, outputFormat);
  console.log("Chart API Data: ", JSON.stringify(response));
};

getChartData();

> Output (With outputFormat value as json):
/*[
{"Day Timestamp":"2023-02-26","Sum of Attestation Requested Count":3.0,"Sum of Attestation Completed Count":0.0,"Success Percentage":0.0,"Failure Percentage":100.0},
{"Day Timestamp":"2023-03-05","Sum of Attestation Requested Count":16.0,"Sum of Attestation Completed Count":2.0,"Success Percentage":12.5,"Failure Percentage":87.5},
{"Day Timestamp":"2023-05-14","Sum of Attestation Requested Count":3.0,"Sum of Attestation Completed Count":0.0,"Success Percentage":0.0,"Failure Percentage":100.0}
]*/

> Output (Without outputFormat):
/*{
  "rows": [["2023-02-26T00:00:00Z"]],
  "cols": [{
      "description": null,
      "semantic_type": null,
      "table_id": 872
    }],
  "insights": [{ "previous-value": 9}],
  "results_timezone": "GMT"
}*/
```

The DappLooker SDK also provides TypeScript support for developers who prefer type-checking and enhanced code editor features.

```jsx
//Typescript
import { DappLookerChartsAPI } from "dapplooker-sdk";

const getChartData = async () => {
  let chartUUID = "dc9b69d8-7ca1-45d4-8ad0-a17f915f3f0"; // Replace it with chart UUID you are working with
  let apiKey = "qzusb5p3q246ip246ab6g0p8ppzb7u"; // Replace it with your API key
  let outputFormat = 'json' // This is a optional argument, valid value is `json`. 
  
  let response = await DappLookerChartsAPI.getChartData(chartUUID, apiKey, outputFormat);
  console.log("Chart API Data: ", JSON.stringify(response));
};

getChartData();

> Output (With outputFormat value as json):
/*[
{"Day Timestamp":"2023-02-26","Sum of Attestation Requested Count":3.0,"Sum of Attestation Completed Count":0.0,"Success Percentage":0.0,"Failure Percentage":100.0},
{"Day Timestamp":"2023-03-05","Sum of Attestation Requested Count":16.0,"Sum of Attestation Completed Count":2.0,"Success Percentage":12.5,"Failure Percentage":87.5},
{"Day Timestamp":"2023-05-14","Sum of Attestation Requested Count":3.0,"Sum of Attestation Completed Count":0.0,"Success Percentage":0.0,"Failure Percentage":100.0}
]*/

> Output (Without outputFormat):
/*{
  "rows": [["2023-02-26T00:00:00Z"]],
  "cols": [{
      "description": null,
      "semantic_type": null,
      "table_id": 872
    }],
  "insights": [{ "previous-value": 9}],
  "results_timezone": "GMT"
}*/
