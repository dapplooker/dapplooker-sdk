# DappLooker SDK
The dapplooker-sdk provides developers with programmatic access to reliable and comprehensive blockchain data in the Web3 environment. By integrating the DappLooker SDK, you can easily retrieve popular charts data for your decentralized applications (Dapps).

> #### Node version: >=14

## Installation
To start using the DappLooker SDK, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install the SDK:
```bash
npm install dapplooker-sdk
```

#### 2. Generate an API key:

- Create an account on the [DappLooker website](https://dapplooker.com/).
- After signing up, navigate to the [API keys](https://dapplooker.com/user/api) page.
  ![img.png](https://d2yxqfr8upg55w.cloudfront.net/npm-package-images/APIPageHighlighted.png)
- Click on `+ API Key`.
  ![img.png](https://d2yxqfr8upg55w.cloudfront.net/npm-package-images/AddKey.png)
- Provide a name for your API key and click on `Generate Key`.
  ![img.png](https://d2yxqfr8upg55w.cloudfront.net/npm-package-images/generateKey.png)
- Copy your API key for future use.

#### 3. Get Your Chart UUID

- Visit the [DappLooker Analytics Website](https://analytics.dapplooker.com/)
- Create a new Chart or Open a Existing Created Chart
  ![ChartImage.png](https://d2yxqfr8upg55w.cloudfront.net/npm-package-images/ChartImage.png)
- Click on the `API` Button
  ![img.png](https://d2yxqfr8upg55w.cloudfront.net/npm-package-images/chartAPIButton.png)
- Get the UUID of your chart from Endpoint of the chart API.

#### 4. Import the SDK

Once you have installed the SDK, import it into your project. With the imported SDK, create an instance of the DappLookerChartsAPI and make API calls using the API key and chart UUID obtained in the previous steps.

### Examples
Here's an example of how you can use the DappLooker SDK:

```javascript
//Javascript
const DappLookerChartsAPI = require("dapplooker-sdk");

async function getChartData() => {
  let chartUUID = "dc9b69d8-7ca1-45d4-8ad0-a17f915f3f0"; // Replace it with chart UUID you are working with
  let apiKey = "qzusb5p3q246ip246ab6g0p8ppzb7u"; // Replace it with your API key
  let outputFormat = 'json'; // This is a optional argument, valid value is `json`.
  let filterParams = {}; 
  
  let response = await DappLookerChartsAPI.getChartData(chartUUID, apiKey, outputFormat, filterParams);
  console.log("API Response Data: ", JSON.stringify(response));
};

getChartData();


> Output (With outputFormat value as json):
/*[
{"Day Timestamp":"2023-02-26","Sum of Attestation Requested Count":3.0,"Sum of Attestation Completed Count":0.0,"Success Percentage":0.0,"Failure Percentage":100.0},
{"Day Timestamp":"2023-03-05","Sum of Attestation Requested Count":16.0,"Sum of Attestation Completed Count":2.0,"Success Percentage":12.5,"Failure Percentage":87.5},
{"Day Timestamp":"2023-05-14","Sum of Attestation Requested Count":3.0,"Sum of Attestation Completed Count":0.0,"Success Percentage":0.0,"Failure Percentage":100.0}
]*/

> Output (Without outputFormat):
/*{
  "rows": [["2023-02-26T00:00:00Z"]],
  "cols": [{
      "description": null,
      "semantic_type": null,
      "table_id": 872
    }],
  "insights": [{ "previous-value": 9}],
  "results_timezone": "GMT"
}*/
```

The DappLooker SDK also provides TypeScript support for developers who prefer type-checking and enhanced code editor features.

```jsx
//Typescript
import { DappLookerChartsAPI } from "dapplooker-sdk";

const getChartData = async () => {
  let chartUUID = "dc9b69d8-7ca1-45d4-8ad0-a17f915f3f0"; // Replace it with chart UUID you are working with
  let apiKey = "qzusb5p3q246ip246ab6g0p8ppzb7u"; // Replace it with your API key
  let outputFormat = 'json'; // This is a optional argument, valid value is `json`.
  let filterParams = {}; 
  
  let response = await DappLookerChartsAPI.getChartData(chartUUID, apiKey, outputFormat, filterParams);
  console.log("API Response Data: ", JSON.stringify(response));
};

getChartData();

> Output (With outputFormat value as json):
/*[
{"Day Timestamp":"2023-02-26","Sum of Attestation Requested Count":3.0,"Sum of Attestation Completed Count":0.0,"Success Percentage":0.0,"Failure Percentage":100.0},
{"Day Timestamp":"2023-03-05","Sum of Attestation Requested Count":16.0,"Sum of Attestation Completed Count":2.0,"Success Percentage":12.5,"Failure Percentage":87.5},
{"Day Timestamp":"2023-05-14","Sum of Attestation Requested Count":3.0,"Sum of Attestation Completed Count":0.0,"Success Percentage":0.0,"Failure Percentage":100.0}
]*/

> Output (Without outputFormat):
/*{
  "rows": [["2023-02-26T00:00:00Z"]],
  "cols": [{
      "description": null,
      "semantic_type": null,
      "table_id": 872
    }],
  "insights": [{ "previous-value": 9}],
  "results_timezone": "GMT"
}*/
```

Here's an example to get the data from AI studio of DappLooker

```jsx
//Typescript
import { DappLookerNlqAPI } from "dapplooker-sdk";

async function getResults(): Promise<any> {
  let apiKey = "d6fbd65055ef4510807fa4eb1662792b"
  let response = await DappLookerNlqAPI.getNlqData(apiKey, 'What is the current gas price per hour on the Ethereum network?', 'ethereum');
  console.log("API Response Data: ", JSON.stringify(response));
};

getResults();

> Output :
/*
